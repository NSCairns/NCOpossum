# NCOpossum
A Minecraft mod for 1.12.2 that adds Opossums with fun little quirks!

Hello, welcome to my first contribution to Github! I made this mod as a passion project for me and my partner. We both loved Opossums and I opted to make my own.

This was my first time creating a Forge mod, the processes was lengthy but I opted to follow the correct procedures of making a mod including all the libraries handlers and methods of registering mobs, models and items. 

This mod features: Opossums that can carry items in their mouths with a visible model animation to support movement and holding items, they can pounce at trees for apples, they will drop items if you hold an "Alfredo" egg, named after a popular Opossum we were fond of. There is also a Wheelie bin, that the opossum can interact with once a day, this has a random chance to drop absolutely any item from the game, including all mod items!

I used this project as a way to express my passion and love for games, coding and the processes behind development, as well as a way to test my motivation, resilience and perseverance when I had to figure out things for myself not covered by the basic tutorials, for example rendering the item and having it follow the opossums idle head movements. 

Thank you for your time to look at my Opossum Mod.
